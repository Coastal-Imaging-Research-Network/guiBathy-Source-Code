% Given a phase tile v at locations xy, find good seed estimates for the
% wave angle and wavenumber that will be used for the nonlinear search in
% csmInvertKAlpha.  This version uses the radon transform to find the
% dominant wave direction.
% Outputs are the two parameters, k and alpha, plus the center index
% of the pixel that is closest to xm, ym.  This will be used to correct
% phase in predictCSM.

%% Apply radon over theta

%% Pick the direction with maximum variance (representing the incident wave angle)

aSeed = -theta(c); % result in radians.

%% Estimate the wave number projected in the incident wave direction.  Establish
%  a grid oriented in the wave direction that spans the original tile, then
%  interp into the original phase map to re-map to wave-directed coords.
%  Then chose the median gradient as the seed wavenumber.
